To run a cell, simply click on it and press `Shift + Enter` or click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar.\n","\n","- Markdown cells: In addition to code cells, you can also create Markdown cells to write descriptive text. You can format the text using Markdown syntax to add headings, lists, links, etc..\n","\n","- Saving and exporting: To save your notebook, click on the \"Save\" button in the toolbar. Jupyter notebooks have the extension `.ipynb` and can be exported to other formats like HTML, PDF, etc.\n","\n","- Keyboard Shortcuts: Jupyter notebooks have several keyboard shortcuts that can make your work faster and more efficient. For example, you can press `Esc` to enter command mode and `Enter` to enter edit mode. The most frequently used Keyboard Shortcuts are: `b` for creating a cell `b`elow the current cell, `a` for creating a cell `a`bove the current cell, `dd` for deleting the current cell."],"metadata":{"id":"lMlZTCNPgNwn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Colab uses Jupyter notebooks\n","\n","Colab allows you to use Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9L7z_03XgXg3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Modules and stuff\n","\n","The nice thing about Colab is it just pretty much knows about the existence of things that we might like to use if you want to import them.
